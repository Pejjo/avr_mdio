# avr_mdio
A small library to emulate MDIO interface on AVR8

This library let you control ethernet phy's from an AVR8 micro controller.
Please note that it is _only_ the MDIO control interface (link status, speed etc) that you can control. 
The data interface is not in the scope of an AVR8 directly.
